<h1>A weather app</h1> made using JavaScript and an API is a software application that displays current and/or forecasted weather conditions for a specific location using data from a weather API.

The app typically consists of a user interface that allows users to input a location or use the device's location services to automatically determine their location. The app then makes a request to a weather API, such as OpenWeatherMap, to retrieve the relevant weather data for that location.

The API response is typically in JSON format, which the app can parse and extract the relevant weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and so on
